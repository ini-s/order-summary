## My process

- I wrote the html.
- I styled with css from the top to the bottom.
- I checked the responsiveness.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

- I learnt how to add a background image. I learnt that background images are repeated by default.
- I learnt that margin: auto can be used to center a block element horizontally.
- I learnt that there is very little i can do to style a line break element .


### Continued development
I want to improve my css styling skills and learn how to use grid and flexbox more for future projects.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me with documentation for how to set background images, margins and styling line break elements in css .
